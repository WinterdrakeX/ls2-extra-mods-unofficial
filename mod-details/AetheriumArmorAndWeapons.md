**Link:** https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/2687

**Summary:** Adds 2 Power Armor Sets and many weapons after unlocking the Aetherium Forge. Can be displayed at the museum using
the LOTD patch.

**LS2 Compatibility Status:** Good (no known stability issues with or without the LOTD patch)

**Recommendations:** 
* WinterdrakeX (Highly Recommend)

**Official Patches:**
* LOTD Patch: https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/30980 (Note: contains 2 ESPs)
* Aetherium Ore Respawns: https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/31416?tab=files

**Custom Patches:**
_None_

**Load/Install Order Notes:**
* WinterdrakeX (LS2 version 2.2.1)
  * AetheriumSwordsnArmor.esp must be loaded before ELE_SSE.esp
  * DBM_AetheriumWeapons_Patch.esp and DBM_ISC_Patch loaded before Bashed Patch, 0.esp (NOTE: I reinstalled the Legacy of the Dragonborn Official Patches with a different name and no other patches enabled to get this)
  * Aetherium Ore Respawns.esp directly place below AetheriumSwordnArmor.esp
  * Shield Menu Mesh fix can be placed anywhere below AetheriumArmornWeaponsSSEv1.0-Loosefiles.

**Extra Notes:**
* Weapons and armor pieces are not currently marked by the Curator's Companion. Will still be displayed if auto-sorted.
* Quests "Unfathomable Depths" and "Lost to the Ages" must be completed in order to be able to craft these equipments.
