**Summary:** Adds a museum containing huge amounts of custom female armor for CBBE.

**LS2 Compatibility Status:** Good (no issues after patching)

**Recommendations:** 
* WinterdrakeX (Highly Recommend)

**Official Patches:**
_None_

**Custom Patches:**
* [JOR - Ninirim Collection / Occlusion Patch](/custom-patches/JOR_Ninirim_Occlusion_Patch.esp) (this currently forwards Occlusion records, would need to redo if Occlusion changes)

**Load/Install Order Notes:**
* WinterdrakeX (LS2 version 2.2.1)
  * Install and move this mod upwards after the separator named "Items - Female Armors". It should only overwrite "unofficial performance optimized textures AKA (UPOT)". Let others overwrite it.
  * Put [Sunjeong] Ninirim Collection.esp a few mods before ELE_SSE.esp (apparently if you stick some mod right before ELE_SSE.esp it sometimes still overwrite ELE_SSE.esp).
  * Add JOR_Ninirim_Occlusion_Patch.esp after Occlusion.esp

**Extra Notes:**
* Credits for the outfits go to Ninirim for the countless years of work he's done. Included more specific credits in an in-game poster inside the museum.
